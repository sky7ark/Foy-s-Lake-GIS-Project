# Foy-s-Lake-GIS-Project
Project: QGIS-based spatial analysis of Foy’s Lake and its environmental impact on surrounding areas
This project uses QGIS to analyze Foy’s Lake in Chattogram, Bangladesh, and assess its potential environmental and social impacts. The main objective was to determine whether the lake has leakage, overflow risks, bank erosion, and how such events could affect surrounding properties within a 5 km radius.

Key Features:
1. Digitized the lake boundary and the surrounding region using QGIS.
2. Conducted spatial analysis to identify nearby properties and infrastructures at risk.
3. Evaluated potential overflow and bank erosion zones using buffer and proximity tools.
4. Created visual maps to highlight vulnerable areas around the lake.
5. Produced a reproducible GIS workflow that can be applied to other water bodies for risk assessment and urban planning.

Tools & Technologies:
1. QGIS - spatial analysis, digitization, buffering, symbology
2. OpenStreetMap / Satellite imagery for basemap and property mapping
3. Geospatial analysis techniques such as buffering, polygon digitization, and overlay analysis
